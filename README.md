Hi, I'm Evgenii Builin, a Russian software engineer.

I have been passionate about coding since the age of 8, and my experience in commercial business software development and modification spans more than 20 years. I have expertise in team leading and software development department management. Since 2019, I have been working as a software development contractor, software architect consultant, and lead a group of high-level contractors.

My primary tech stack includes Java, Spring Framework (including Spring Boot and Spring Cloud), Kafka, PostgreSQL. I have experience in developing backend REST APIs, full-stack MVC applications, and integrations via mesasge brokers.
